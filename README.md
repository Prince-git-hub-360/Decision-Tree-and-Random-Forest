Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest models
# ðŸ§© Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To implement and understand Decision Tree and Random Forest models for classification using the Heart Disease Dataset.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas, NumPy

---

## ðŸ“Š Steps Followed
1. Loaded and explored the Heart Disease dataset.
2. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized it.
3. Controlled overfitting using parameters like `max_depth`.
4. Trained a Random Forest Classifier and compared performance.
5. Interpreted feature importance.
6. Evaluated using cross-validation and confusion matrix.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|
| Decision Tree | ~0.77 |
| Pruned Tree | ~0.80 |
| Random Forest | ~0.86 |
